<div class="about-text">
  <p>I study the history and science of thought, to understand how the heck anyone ever
    figured anything out. I am currently designing and teaching two courses at McMaster University:
    an introduction to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ncz7ULFcX3zASSr4GufMVg6jx-xnQLzNQpwmdMtZeB8/edit" target="_blank">history of science</a>,
    and an overview of the social issues surrounding <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vxDhD2yixAGMfLhbd6ncGF1gFJAenRT3AXqiu91wVo4/edit" target="_blank">artificial intelligence</a>.
    I’ve done research on <a href="https://osf.io/cvw8s/" target="_blank">moral psychology on Twitter</a>,
    and worked with NYU’s <a href="https://www.labdevelopingmind.com" target="_blank">Lab for the Developing Mind</a>
    to study the nature of geometric intutions. I am currently producing a podcast on the making
    of the atomic bomb. I spend the rest of my time doing improv comedy, zooming through audiobooks,
    watching basketball, and playing chess.
