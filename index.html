  <p>
    I study the history and science of thought, to understand how the heck anyone ever
    figured anything out. I try to read widely and share ideas clearly---especially
    ideas about the past, present, and future of science.

    I am currently designing and teaching two courses at McMaster University:
    an introduction to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ncz7ULFcX3zASSr4GufMVg6jx-xnQLzNQpwmdMtZeB8/edit" target="_blank">history of science</a>,
    and an overview of the social issues surrounding <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vxDhD2yixAGMfLhbd6ncGF1gFJAenRT3AXqiu91wVo4/edit" target="_blank">artificial intelligence</a>.
    Iâ€™ve previously studied studied moral psychology, cognitive science, history, mathematics,
    and physics, and some of my work is on the Projects page.

    I spend the rest of my time performing funk music, doing improv comedy, zooming through audiobooks,
    watching basketball, and playing chess.
