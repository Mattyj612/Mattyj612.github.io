    Hello! My name is Matthew Jordan, and I'm a university instructor, science communicator, and
    funk musician. My central driving belief is that everyone should have access to scientific knowledge,
    presented in an accessible and unpretentious way. <a href="/projects/">My work</a>
    synthesizes ideas about science and its history, in the hope that by understanding
    the past we can improve the future. Basically, I ask: how the heck did anyone ever figure anything out?
    I spend the rest of my time zooming through audiobooks, doing improv comedy, watching basketball,
    solving crosswords, and playing chess.
<!--    an introduction to
    the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ncz7ULFcX3zASSr4GufMVg6jx-xnQLzNQpwmdMtZeB8/edit" target="_blank">history of science</a>,
    and an overview of the social issues around <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wrSf6t_S6OjpKqpLJCzUVcJiNz5WHRPHeuEvHKXXIMQ/edit#" target="_blank">artificial intelligence</a>.
    I also do <a href="/projects/" target="_blank">research</a> in cognitive science and history,
    help run the <a href="https://joininteract.com/" target="_blank">Interact Fellowship</a>, and am producing
    an authorized podcast version of Richard Rhodes' <i>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</i>.
    I spend the rest of my time performing funk music, doing improv comedy, zooming through audiobooks, watching basketball,
    solving crosswords, and playing chess.-->
