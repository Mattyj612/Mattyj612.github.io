  <p>
    I study the history and science of thought, to understand how the heck anyone ever
    figured anything out. I try to read widely and share ideas clearly &mdash especially
    ideas about the past, present, and future of science.<br>

    I'm currently teaching two courses I created for McMaster University:
    an introduction to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ncz7ULFcX3zASSr4GufMVg6jx-xnQLzNQpwmdMtZeB8/edit" target="_blank">history of science</a>,
    and an overview of the issues around <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vxDhD2yixAGMfLhbd6ncGF1gFJAenRT3AXqiu91wVo4/edit" target="_blank">artificial intelligence</a>.
    Iâ€™ve previously studied studied moral psychology on Twitter, the origin of mathematical intutions,
    and the history of AI; some out that work on the Projects page.<br>

    I spend the rest of my time performing funk music, doing improv comedy, zooming through audiobooks,
    watching basketball, and playing chess.
