I teach a course at McMaster University called *Innovate 1Z03*, which explores
the history, philosophy, and ethics of artificial intelligence. You can find the
most recent version of the course outline <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wrSf6t_S6OjpKqpLJCzUVcJiNz5WHRPHeuEvHKXXIMQ/edit#" target="_blank">here</a>. I record
my lectures as podcasts, and you can listen to them on your favorite podcast app by
simply searching "Innovate 1Z03".

Here it is on Spotify:
